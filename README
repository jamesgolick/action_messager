= ActionMessager

ActionMessager is dead simple IM notifications for your app.

== Get It
  
    $ sudo gem install action_messager
    
    ... or get the source ...
    
    $ git clone git@github.com:giraffesoft/action_messager.git
    
== Usage

ActionMessager works just like ActionMailer. All you have to do start sending IM notifications to your users is subclass ActionMessager::Base; then, create a method that sets an array of recipients, and returns the message you'd like to send:

  class JabberNotifier < ActionMessager::Base
    def friendship_request(friendship_request)
      @recipients = friendship_request.receiver.jabber_contact
      
      "You have received a friendship request from #{friendship_request.sender.name}! Click here to accept or decline: #{friendship_request.url}"
    end
  end
  
Then, wherever you'd like to send the notification:

  JabberNotifier.deliver_friendship_request(friendship_request)
  
That's it!

== Configuration

You'll need to configure ActionMessager with your jabber credentials.

  ActionMessager::Base.jabber_settings = {
    :username => 'somebody@somejabberserver.com',
    :password => 'swordfish!'
  }
